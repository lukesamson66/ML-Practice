Project:
    Comparing Machine Learning models to accurately predict breast cancer tumor diagnosis.

Description:
    The goal of this project is to compare how well Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Neural Network Machine Learning models can predict a cancer diagnosis
    using tumor data. We consider this a Binary Classification problem, as each tumor in the dataset will either be "M" for malignant (cancerous), or "B" for benign 
    (not cancerous).

Dataset:
    The dataset I used is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" data set. This dataset provides tumor characteristics such as radius, concavity, and symmerty, 
    and provides a response variable in "Diagnosis". This response will either be "M" for malignant, or "B" for benign.
